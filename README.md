# SkX_NN
A small U-net for identifying Neel skyrmions in Lorentz TEM images, as outlined in the paper [Simulation-trained machine learning models for Lorentz transmission electron microscopy](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0197138). 

This repository contains a convoloutional neural-net and an example image showing its operation. Simply download the repository and run the Jupyter notebook. Pytorch, scipy, and scikit-image are required packages.
